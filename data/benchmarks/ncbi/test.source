["cycloheximide facilitates the identification of aberrant transcripts resulting from a novel splice-site mutation in col17a1 in a patient with generalized START atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa END . patients with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa often show decreased expression of type xvii collagen, a transmembrane hemidesmosomal protein encoded by col17a1. this report documents a novel splice-site mutation in col17a1 in a patient with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa, and applies a new methodology to define and characterize the resulting mrna splice variants. mutational analysis of col17a1 identified a maternally inherited g-to-t transversion at the -1 position of exon 32. this acceptor splice-site mutation led to the formation of aberrant transcripts present at extremely low levels. based on our recent finding that cycloheximide stabilized mutant col17a1 transcripts in keratinocytes homozygous for a frameshift mutation, the effects of the splice-site mutation on splicing of col17a1 transcripts were determined using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of total rna from keratinocytes incubated for 2. 5 h in the presence or absence of 10 microg cycloheximide per ml. using this approach, an abnormally spliced transcript was identified that contains an extra 264 bases upstream from exon 32, resulting in a premature termination codon 27 bp downstream from the cryptic splice site. three other splice variants, including one derived from the skipping of exon 32, were also identified. these results indicate the usefulness of cycloheximide treatment in evaluating the abnormal processing of mrna due to splice-site mutations, because  (i) aberrant splicing often generates a premature termination codon, (ii) transcripts with premature termination codons can occur at low or undetectable levels due to nonsense-mediated mrna decay, and (iii) the levels of these transcripts can be increased by cycloheximide."]

["the START tumor END suppressor gene smad4/dpc4 is required for gastrulation and later for anterior development of the mouse embryo. mutations in the smad4/dpc4 tumor suppressor gene, a key signal transducer in most tgfbeta-related pathways, are involved in 50% of pancreatic cancers. homozygous smad4 mutant mice die before day 7. 5 of embryogenesis. mutant embryos have reduced size, fail to gastrulate or express a mesodermal marker, and show abnormal visceral endoderm development. growth retardation of the smad4-deficient embryos results from reduced cell proliferation rather than increased apoptosis. aggregation of mutant smad4 es cells with wild-type tetraploid morulae rescues the gastrulation defect. these results indicate that smad4 is initially required for the differentiation of the visceral endoderm and that the gastrulation defect in the epiblast is secondary and non-cell autonomous. rescued embryos show severe anterior truncations, indicating a second important role for smad4 in anterior patterning during embryogenesis."]

["constitutional rb1-gene mutations in patients with isolated START unilateral retinoblastoma END . in most patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma, tumor development is initiated by somatic inactivation of both alleles of the rb1 gene. however, some of these patients can transmit retinoblastoma predisposition to their offspring. to determine the frequency and nature of constitutional rb1-gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma, we analyzed dna from peripheral blood and from tumor tissue. the analysis of tumors from 54 (71%) of 76 informative patients showed loss of constitutional heterozygosity (loh) at intragenic loci. three of 13 uninformative patients had constitutional deletions. for 39 randomly selected tumors, sscp, hetero-duplex analysis, sequencing, and southern blot analysis were used to identify mutations. mutations were detected in 21 (91%) of 23 tumors with loh. in 6 (38%) of 16 tumors without loh, one mutation was detected, and in 9 (56%) of the tumors without loh, both mutations were found. thus, a total of 45 mutations were identified in tumors of 36 patients. thirty-nine of the mutations-including 34 small mutations, 2 large structural alterations, and hypermethylation in 3 tumors-were not detected in the corresponding peripheral blood dna. in 6 (17%) of the 36 patients, a mutation was detected in constitutional dna, and 1 of these mutations is known to be associated with reduced expressivity. the presence of a constitutional mutation was not associated with an early age at treatment. in 1 patient, somatic mosaicism was demonstrated by molecular analysis of dna and rna from peripheral blood. in 2 patients without a detectable mutation in peripheral blood, mosaicism was suggested because 1 of the patients showed multifocal tumors and the other later developed bilateral retinoblastoma. in conclusion, our results emphasize that the manifestation and transmissibility of retinoblastoma depend on the nature of the first mutation, its time in development, and the number and types of cells that are affected.."]

["distribution of emerin and lamins in the heart and implications for START emery dreifuss muscular dystrophy END . emerin is a nuclear membrane protein which is missing or defective in emery-dreifuss muscular dystrophy (edmd). it is one member of a family of lamina-associated proteins which includes lap1, lap2 and lamin b receptor (lbr). a panel of 16 monoclonal antibodies (mabs) has been mapped to six specific sites throughout the emerin molecule using phage-displayed peptide libraries and has been used to localize emerin in human and rabbit heart. several mabs against different emerin epitopes did not recognize intercalated discs in the heart, though they recognized cardiomyocyte nuclei strongly, both at the rim and in intranuclear spots or channels. a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against emerin did recognize both nuclear membrane and intercalated discs but, after affinity purification against a pure-emerin band on a western blot, it stained only the nuclear membrane. these results would not be expected if immunostaining at intercalated discs were due to a product of the emerin gene and, therefore, cast some doubt upon the hypothesis that cardiac defects in edmd are caused by absence of emerin from intercalated discs. although emerin was abundant in the membranes of cardiomyocyte nuclei, it was absent from many non-myocyte cells in the heart. this distribution of emerin was similar to that of lamin a, a candidate gene for an autosomal form of edmd. in contrast, lamin b1 was absent from cardiomyocyte nuclei, showing that lamin b1 is not essential for localization of emerin to the nuclear lamina. lamin b1 is also almost completely absent from skeletal muscle nuclei. in edmd, the additional absence of lamin b1 from heart and skeletal muscle nuclei which already lack emerin may offer an alternative explanation of why these tissues are particularly affected.."]

["truncation mutations in the transactivation region of pax6 result in dominant-negative mutants. pax6 is a transcription factor with two dna-binding domains (paired box and homeobox) and a proline-serine-threonine (pst) -rich transactivation domain. pax6 regulates eye development in animals ranging from jellyfish to drosophila to humans. heterozygous mutations in the human pax6 gene result in various phenotypes, including START aniridia END , peters anomaly, autosomal dominant keratitis, and familial foveal dysplasia. it is believed that the mutated allele of pax6 produces an inactive protein and aniridia is caused due to genetic haploinsufficiency. however, several truncation mutations have been found to occur in the c-terminal half of pax6 in patients with aniridia resulting in mutant proteins that retain the dna-binding domains but have lost most of the transactivation domain. it is not clear whether such mutants really behave as loss-of-function mutants as predicted by haploinsufficiency. contrary to this theory, our data showed that these mutants are dominant-negative in transient transfection assays when they are coexpressed with wild-type pax6. we found that the dominant-negative effects result from the enhanced dna binding ability of these mutants. kinetic studies of binding and dissociation revealed that various truncation mutants have 3-5-fold higher affinity to various dna-binding sites when compared with the wild-type pax6. these results provide a new insight into the role of mutant pax6 in causing aniridia.."]

["a novel arg362ser mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (cyp27): its effects on pre-mrna splicing and enzyme activity. a novel c to a mutation in the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (cyp27) was identified by sequencing amplified cyp27 gene products from a patient with START cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis END (ctx). the mutation changed the adrenodoxin cofactor binding residue 362arg to 362ser (cgt 362arg to agt 362ser), and was responsible for deficiency in the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, as confirmed by expression of mutant cdna into cos-1 cells. quantitative analysis showed that the expression of cyp27 gene mrna in the patient represented 52. 5% of the normal level. as the mutation occurred at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 (-2 position of exon 6-intron 6 splice site) of the gene, we hypothesized that the mutation may partially affect the normal splicing efficiency in exon 6 and cause alternative splicing elsewhere, which resulted in decreased transcript in the patient. transfection of constructed minigenes, with or without the mutation, into cos-1 cells confirmed that the mutant minigene was responsible for a mrna species alternatively spliced at an activated cryptic 5 splice site 88 bp upstream from the 3 end of exon 6. our data suggest that the c to a mutation at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 6 of the cyp27 gene not only causes the deficiency in the sterol 27-hydroxylase activity, but also partially leads to alternative pre-mrna splicing of the gene. to our knowledge, this is the first report regarding effects on pre-mrna splicing of a mutation at the -2 position of a 5 splice site."]
