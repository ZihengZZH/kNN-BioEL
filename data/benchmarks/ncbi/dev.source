["the 5' end of the brca1 gene lies within a duplicated region of human chromosome 17q21. to begin to address the hypothesis that abnormal regulation of the START breast ovarian cancer END susceptibility gene brca1 is a critical step in sporadic breast/ovarian tumorigenesis, we have determined the detailed structure of the brca1 genomic region. we show that this region of the genome contains a tandem duplication of approximately 30 kilobases, which results in two copies of brca1 exons 1 and 2, of exons 1 and 3 of the adjacent 1a1-3b gene and of the previously reported 295 base pair intergenic region. sequence analysis of the duplicated exons of brca1 and 1a1-3b and flanking genomic dna reveals maintenance of the intron-exon structure and a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity, suggesting that these are non-processed pseudogenes and that the duplication is a recent event in evolutionary terms. we also show that a processed pseudogene of the acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein p1 (arpp1) is inserted directly upstream of pseudo-brca1 exon 1a. we believe that these findings could not only confound brca1 mutation analysis, but could have implications for the normal and abnormal regulation of brca1 transcription, translation and function.."]
["influence of pax6 gene dosage on development: overexpression causes severe START eye abnormalities END . aniridia in man and small eye in mice are semidominant developmental disorders caused by mutations within the paired box gene pax6. whereas heterozygotes suffer from iris hypoplasia, homozygous mice lack eyes and nasal cavities and exhibit brain abnormalities. to investigate the role of gene dosage in more detail, we have generated yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice carrying the human pax6 locus. when crossed onto the small eye background, the transgene rescues the mutant phenotype. strikingly, mice carrying multiple copies on a wild-type background show specific developmental abnormalities of the eye, but not of other tissues expressing the gene. thus, at least five different eye phenotypes are associated with changes in pax6 expression. we provide evidence that not only reduced, but also increased levels of transcriptional regulators can cause developmental defects.."]

["detection of heterozygous mutations in brca1 using high density oligonucleotide arrays and two-colour fluorescence analysis. the ability to scan a large gene rapidly and accurately for all possible heterozygous mutations in large numbers of patient samples will be critical for the future of medicine. we have designed high-density arrays consisting of over 96, 600 oligonucleotides 20-nucleotides (nt) in length to screen for a wide range of heterozygous mutations in the 3. 45-kilobases (kb) exon 11 of the START hereditary breast and ovarian cancer END gene brca1. reference and test samples were co-hybridized to these arrays and differences in hybridization patterns quantitated by two-colour analysis. fourteen of fifteen patient samples with known mutations were accurately diagnosed, and no false positive mutations were identified in 20 control samples. eight single nucleotide polymorphisms were also readily detected. dna chip-based assays may provide a valuable new technology for high-throughput cost-efficient detection of genetic alterations."]

["molecular basis for START duarte and los angeles variant galactosemia END . human orythrocytes that are homozygous for the duarte enzyme variant of galactosemia (d/d) have a characteristic isoform on isoelectric focusing and 50% reduction in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (galt) enzyme activity. the duarte biochemical phenotype has a molecular genotype of n314d/n314d. the characteristic duarte isoform is also associated with a variant called the \" los angeles (la) phenotype, \" which has increased galt enzyme activity. we evaluated galt enzyme activity and screened the galt genes of 145 patients with one or more n314d-containing alleles. we found seven with the la biochemical phenotype, and all had a 1721c-- > t transition in exon 7 in cis with the n314d missense mutation. the 1721c-- > t transition is a neutral polymorphism for leucine at amino acid 218 (l218l). in pedigree analyses, this 1721c-- > t transition segregated with the la phenotype of increased galt activity in three different biochemical phenotypes (la/n, la/g, and la/d). to determine the mechanism for increased activity of the la variant, we compared galt mrna, protein abundance, and enzyme thermal stability in lymphoblast cell lines of d and la phenotypes with comparable genotypes. galt protein abundance was increased in la compared to d alleles, but mrna was similar among all genotypes. when la/d and d/d galt biochemical phenotypes were compared to n/n galt phenotypes, both had 50%, as compared to 21%, reduction in galt activity in the wild type (n/n) after exposure at identical initial enzyme activity to 50 degrees c for 15 min. we conclude that the codon change n314d in cis with the base-pair transition 1721c-- > t produces the la variant of galactosemia and that this nucleotide change increases galt activity by increasing galt protein abundance without increasing transcription or decreasing thermal lability. a favorable codon bias for the mutated codon with consequently increased translation rates is postulated as the mechanism.."]
